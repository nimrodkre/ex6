The tool's logic is written in one module. The Tool s divided into three menus, each has its own function:
the enter menu, the edit menu, and the exit menu.
Each edit option has its own function.
In order to connect to the menus and the logic an executor model was chosen implemented by dictionaries:
Each key is a command from the user and the value is the matching logic function to run.
Each function is independent, and connection is via parameters only.
