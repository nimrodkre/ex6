The tool's logic is written in one module. The Tool s divided into three
menus, each has its own function:
1. enter menu
2. edit menu,
3. exit menu
Each edit option has its own function.
In order to connect to the menus and the logic an executor model
was chosen implemented by dictionaries:
Each key is a command from the user and the value is the matching logic
function to run. Each function is independent, and connection is via
parameters only.
This type of programming allows our program to more dynamic to changes.
Each type of change to the audio file, is written as an independent module,
while allows us to add or remove functions at ease.
